### Problem Statement

I am moving to California. So, I am looking at the possible schools that I can enrol my son so that he can eventually go to college of his choice.


### Datasets

#### Below are the datasets that I am using for this analysis

There are 10 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. You are required to pick **at least two** of these to complete your analysis. Feel free to use more than two if you would like, or add other relevant datasets you find online.
