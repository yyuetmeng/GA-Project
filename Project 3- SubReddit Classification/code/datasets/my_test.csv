0,"I recently got my license in October and my parents “gave” me their 2018 Honda civic LX. I just drive it to school and get to use it whenever, so even though its not “mine” I’m the one driving it 80% of the timeI love that car. When the new 2022 civics came out i hated the look of them. I still prefer the old look tbh. My parents were looking to trade in our suv for a hybrid with the price of gas going up and the salesman convinced them to trade in both cars for a new 2022 civic sport and an accord hybrid. I will be driving the new civic which is fine and I got to pick the colour and everything but I feel like im going to regret it and miss my current car. Am I just being stubborn like is a 2022 civic sport genuinely a better car than a 2018 LX",1
1,"Is the first service always going to be service code ""A1""? I believe the dealership accidentally reset my service code during warranty work bc when I brought it in I remember it being at 90% oil life when I got it back after the repairs were completed, the oil life was at 100% with service code B. I confirmed that no service maintenance was ever done on the car. Currently have 1k miles on the car.",1
2,"Anyone here have experience with adding a turbo blanket to their Mazda, curious on your thoughts?

Looking to buy the CX-50 Turbo trim and looking into all things turbo - including best practices. Came across the Turbo blanket accessory one can buy to limit the amount of heat getting to near by components, and holding in turbo heat for increased pressure.",0
3,what's going on everyone? Hope everyone had a good weekend and a good Monday. This is my first time posting on here and was wondering where and what is the best place to find replacement for all of my mounts. Haven't changed them since and just got the vibrating sound on my passenger side mount. Its a 2011 Mazda 3 I touring edition. Any additional information is important and plenty helpful. I do appreciate it. Hoping to get them replaced and purchase a CX-5 in the summer.,0
