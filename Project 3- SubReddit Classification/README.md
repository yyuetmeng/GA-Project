#  Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

### Description

Honda Customer Service main priority is to provide excellent service to our customers. 
Recently, our customer service has been receiving a lot of irrelevant posts from Mazda. This is likely due to the year end promotion sales 
launched by Mazda. This has caused unnecessary stress to the team to keep up with the desired service level agreement.
Today my main objective is to desugb a proof of concept using NLP and Machine Learning to analyze and segregate the posts and provide a solution
to the customer service team

My goal is two-fold:
1. Using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API to collect posts from two subreddits (r/honda and r/mazda).
2. I will then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. Aim is to segregate the posts and provide a solution customer service team
