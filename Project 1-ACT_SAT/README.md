### Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT â€“ I am part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates

### Datasets

#### Below are the datasets that I am using for this analysis

There are 10 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. You are required to pick **at least two** of these to complete your analysis. Feel free to use more than two if you would like, or add other relevant datasets you find online.
