# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

Background
I am a working for an Auction House. I have a  list of houses that I intend to put up for auction in Ames.  So, thus I collected the past housing dataset in Ames to research and eventually set a minimum Sale Price of the houses for the auction. 


**Primary Objectives:**
1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model
2. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.
3. Present the predicted price for the list houses to be auctioned

I am given a train dataset and test dataset on the Ames Housing Dataset. The model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.
My task is to:
- Refine models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science


## The Modeling Process

1. The train dataset has all of the columns that to generate and refine the models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that I am trying to predict in your Regression model.
2. Generate regression model using the training data. 
    - train-test split
    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters
    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables
    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)
3. Predict the values for the target column in the test dataset and submitting the predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.
 
4. Evaluate the models!
    - consider the evaluation metrics
    - consider the baseline score
    - how can my model be used for inference
    - how the model will generalize to new data

## Submission

My technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. It includes:

- A README.md 
- Jupyter notebook(s) with my analysis and models 
- At least one successful prediction submission on [DSI-US-11 Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-11-project-2-regression-challenge) 
- Data files
- Presentation slides
